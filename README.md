# Sudoku_scanner
Simple app to test some openCV into Android.
The idea is to acquire a photo of a sudoku, register it (like CamScanner does) and then use ocr to read its numbers.
The project is incomplete because of lack of time (university studies) and I don't know when I will dedicate myself to it again..
(yeah it's all in the main thread and a lot of good practice rules are violated, I just wanted to try some opencv stuff)
