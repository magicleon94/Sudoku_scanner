# Sudoku_scanner
Tiny experiment which led to an almost complete acquisition of a Sudoku in Android. Starting from a photo, the user chooses in an interactive way the keypoints to register the image (like CamScanner). When the image is registered, an adaptive binarization is done and a simple OCR is performed.
The project is left undone because of lack of time and because I've acquired what I needed, so no further development was necessary, since this was not a "real" app to be released.
(yeah it's all in the main thread and a lot of good practice rules are violated, I just wanted to try some opencv stuff)
